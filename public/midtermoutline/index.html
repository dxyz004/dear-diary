<li>
<p><strong>Know the principles of Object Oriented programming (inheritance, encapsulation etc.)</strong></p>
<p>Use All to Achieve OO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance: Is an ability to inherit. Function implementations (behaviors) by a subclass from a super class. Main benefit is software reuse.
&ldquo;No silver bullet&rdquo;.
Drawback: class hierarchy.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: Is an ability to provide multiple implementations for a single function declaration. Simplifies code. Complicates testing. Superclass shape example: We need to have an array of shapes. We can use a general &ldquo;shape&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: Is hiding an object&rsquo;s state. Ex: Not wanting to change attributes. Increases reliability&ndash;a reliable system doesn&rsquo;t have many bugs on paths of frequent executions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be able to give an overview of the Extreme Programming process from the survey of agile processes</strong></p>
<p><em>3.1.1. Process (Figure 2. Life cycle &hellip;)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08439" target="_blank">agilecomp.pdf</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know the principles of Model-Driven development and its advantages</strong></p>
<p>Model driven paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is defined as an executable specification which is an object-oriented analysis model.</li>
<li>The system is validated at the analysis model level.</li>
<li>A software and execution architecture is defined as a set of class templates in an object-oriented programming system.</li>
<li>The executable system is realized by compilation of the validated analysis model to the software execution architecture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using models to design complex systems is derigeur (strictness) in traditional engineering disciplines. No one would imagine constructing an edifice as complex as a bridge or an automobile without first constructing a variety of specialized system models from using models and modeling techniques. Models help us understand a complex problem and its potential solutions through abstraction. Therefore, it seems obvious that software systems, which are often among the most complex engineering systems, can benefit greatly.</p>
<p>MDD’s defining characteristic is that software
development’s primary focus and products are
models rather than computer programs.The
major advantage of this is that we express
models using concepts that are much less
bound to the underlying implementation
technology and are much closer to the problem
domain relative to most popular programming
languages. This makes the models easier to
specify, understand, verify and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural style - its constraints and benefits</strong></p>
<p>Constraints and benefits: <a href="https://heuristic-brahmagupta-965a2c.netlify.app/uploads/model-view-controller.PDF" target="_blank">model-view-controller.PDF</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusability of application and / or user interface components,</li>
<li>Ability to develop the application and user interface separately,</li>
<li>Ability to inherit from different parts of the class hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know how to implement event-based notification in Java</strong></p>
<p>General idea/Code snippets from MVC pdf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know the syntax of the class diagram language (class representations, various kinds of associations)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know the syntax of the statechart diagram language</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be able to create a class diagram and a statechart from requirements</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Know what is tested in different stages of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance, regression)</strong></p>
<p><strong>V</strong>alidation: techniques for assessing the quality of a software product.</p>
<p><strong>V</strong>erification: the use of analytic inference to (formally) prove that a product is consistent with a specification of its intent</p>
<p>Types of Testing—what is tested</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit: exercise a single simple component
<ul>
<li>Procedure</li>
<li>Class</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration: exercise a collection of interdependent components
<ul>
<li>Focus on interfaces between components</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>System: exercise a complete, stand-alone system</li>
<li>Acceptance: customer&rsquo;s evaluation of a system
<ul>
<li>Usually a form of system testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regression: exercise a changed system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be able to create testcases with a JUnit framework</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/" target="_blank">https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be able to create testcases according to boundary, statement and edge coverage criteria</strong></p>

<p><strong>Review Session</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism. June 3 pdf. Definition, benefits and downsides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw Figure 2 diagram or textually describe the different phases. (Pair programming mentioned in class, senior-junior example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model Driven. Goal is to manage the scale of large systems. Theoretically spend all your time designing so coding/product can be automated/easier. Less testing because more validation. &ldquo;The system is validated at the analysis model level&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model-View-Controller. Recreate SUN diagram above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prof&rsquo;s favorite (often mentioned) benefit: Ability to create multiple views w/o shutting down the model.</li>
<li>Reusability of application and/or user interface compoents</li>
<li>Ability to develop the application&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic ideas for implementation and methodology. Probably not code-based testing on MT. &ldquo;Modern software can talk with other software&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create your own diagrams. More &ldquo;flexible&rdquo; than library example (of which the blank boxes represent short-term/long-term goals)&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Unit Testing in Java: How Tests Drive the Code&rdquo; supplementary textbook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a control flow graph. Write out paths that satisfy edge converage. Write conditions. Write test cases. Are there any infeasible paths?</p>
