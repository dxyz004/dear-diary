	Use All to Achieve OO:
	- Inheritance: Is an ability to inherit. Function implementations (behaviors) by a subclass from a super class. Main benefit is software reuse.
	"No silver bullet".
	Drawback: class hierarchy.
	- Polymorphism: Is an ability to provide multiple implementations for a single function declaration. Simplifies code. Complicates testing. Superclass shape example: We need to have an array of shapes. We can use a general "shape".
	- Encapsulation: Is hiding an object's state. Ex: Not wanting to change attributes. Increases reliability--a reliable system doesn't have many bugs on paths of frequent executions.
 2. **Be able to give an overview of the Extreme Programming process from the survey of agile processes**

 3. **Know the principles of Model-Driven development and its advantages**
 
	Model driven paradigm:
	- The system is defined as an executable specification which is an object-oriented analysis model.
	- The system is validated at the analysis model level.
	- A software and execution architecture is defined as a set of class templates in an object-oriented programming system.
	- The executable system is realized by compilation of the validated analysis model to the software execution architecture.
	
	Advantages/Why:

 9. **Know what is tested in different stages of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance, regression)**
 
	Verification and Validation
	
	Types of Testingâ€”what is tested
	- Unit:
