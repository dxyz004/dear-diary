1. **Know the principles of Object Oriented programming (inheritance, encapsulation etc.)**

    Use All to Achieve OO:
    * Inheritance: Is an ability to inherit. Function implementations (behaviors) by a subclass from a super class. Main benefit is software reuse.
      "No silver bullet".
      Drawback: class hierarchy.
    * Polymorphism: Is an ability to provide multiple implementations for a single function declaration. Simplifies code. Complicates testing. Superclass shape example: We need to have an array of shapes. We can use a general "shape".
    * Encapsulation: Is hiding an object's state. Ex: Not wanting to change attributes. Increases reliability--a reliable system doesn't have many bugs on paths of frequent executions.
 2. **Be able to give an overview of the Extreme Programming process from the survey of agile processes**

 3. **Know the principles of Model-Driven development and its advantages**

    Model driven paradigm:
    * The system is defined as an executable specification which is an object-oriented analysis model.
    * The system is validated at the analysis model level.
    * A software and execution architecture is defined as a set of class templates in an object-oriented programming system.
    * The executable system is realized by compilation of the validated analysis model to the software execution architecture.

    Advantages/Why:

 4. **Know the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural style - its constraints and benefits**

	Constraints and benefits: [model-view-controller.PDF](https://heuristic-brahmagupta-965a2c.netlify.app/uploads/model-view-controller.PDF)

 5. **Know how to implement event-based notification in Java**

    General Idea/Code snippets from MVC pdf.
 6. **Know the syntax of the class diagram language (class representations, various kinds of associations)**
 7. **Know the syntax of the statechart diagram language**
 8. **Be able to create a class diagram and a statechart from requirements**

    Class diagram: Library Example

    Statechart: ExceptionAndLightBulbClass.pdf
 9. **Know what is tested in different stages of testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance, regression)**

    **V**alidation: techniques for assessing the quality of a software product.
    
    **V**erification: the use of analytic inference to (formally) prove that a product is consistent with a specification of its intent

    Types of Testingâ€”what is tested
    * Unit: exercise a single simple component
      * Procedure
      * Class
    * Integration: exercise a collection of interdependent components
      * Focus on interfaces between components
    * System: exercise a complete, stand-alone system
    * Acceptance: customer's evaluation of a system
      * Usually a form of system testing
    * Regression: exercise a changed system

10. **Be able to create testcases with a JUnit framework**

    (no coding/not asked)
11. **Be able to create testcases according to boundary, statement and edge coverage criteria**

<p style="text-align: center;">03/08/22 Review Session</p>

- Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism. June 3 pdf. Definition, benefits and downsides.

- Draw Figure 2 diagram or textually describe the different phases. (Pair programming mentioned in class, senior-junior example)

- Model Driven. Goal is to manage the scale of large systems. Theoretically spent all your time designing so coding/product can be automated/easier. Less testing because more validation. "The system is validated at the analysis model level".

- Model-View-Controller. Recreate SUN diagram above.
   * Prof's favorite (often mentioned) benefit: Ability to create multiple views w/o shutting down the model.
   * Reusability of application and/or user interface compoents
   * Ability to develop the application...

- Basic ideas for implementation and methodology. Probably not code-based testing on MT. "Modern software can talk with other software".

- Create your own diagrams. More "flexibile" than library example (of which the blank boxes represent short-term/long-term goals)...

	**Statechart** ExceptionAndLightBulbClass.pdf ...

- "Unit Testing in Java: How Tests Drive the Code" supplementary textbook

- Create a control flow graph. Write out paths that satisfy edge converage. Write conditions. Write test cases. Invisible paths vs visible paths.
