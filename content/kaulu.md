Kaulu (kah-oo-loo) is a Hawaiian word for a mythological trickster god. The search engine borrows its fun (with less mischief) sounding name.

Demonstration notes:
- The local search functionality is handled using Lucene. The web search functionality is handled using a Google API.
- To run/host the local search component, one may install and set up Apache Tomcat and drag the "jsp" folder into Tomcat's "webapps" directory and access http://localhost:8080/jsp (8080 by default) in a web browser while Tomcat is running.
